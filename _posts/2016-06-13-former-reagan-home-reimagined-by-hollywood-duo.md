  Emmy winning producer Michael Mannheim ("Roe vs. Wade") and Tony-nominated
  screenwriter Janus Cercone ("Leap of Faith") sort of fell backwards into
  developing high-end properties. At first the real estate obsessed couple
  enthusiastically re-imagined numerous homes for themselves but eventually, in
  2003, they turned their increasingly full-time avocation in to a bone fide
  profession.
